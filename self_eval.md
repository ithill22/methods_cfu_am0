# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel relatively comfortable. But it is a lot of new information so I am worried I will forget a lot before mod 1 begins
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I am fairly confident I can make simple method on my own.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
What is the real world use of '!'? I would imagine it is used when applying a method to an array so that you can see which objects were not affected.
